# qpwgraph User Manual

**qpwgraph** is a graph manager dedicated to [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org),
using the [Qt C++ framework](https://qt.io), based and pretty much like the
same of [QjackCtl](https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io). The source code is
available [on freedesktop.org's
GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/rncbc/qpwgraph) and also mirrored [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rncbc/qpwgraph).

The core of the interface is a canvas showing all relevant nodes from PipeWire,
with their available ports.

## Ports

Ports are directional, they can be either:

* Source ports (i.e. output). Located at the right-most edge of a node, they
  generate an audio/video/midi stream.
* Sink ports (i.e. input). Located at the left-most edge of a node, they
  consume an audio/video/midi stream.

Ports also have different types:

* Audio (default color: green)
* Video (default color: blue)
* PipeWire/JACK MIDI (default color: red)
* ALSA MIDI (default color: purple)

Ports of the same type and opposite directions can be connected.

## Configuration file

qpwgraph will remember the position of each node, as well as their custom names.

The configuration is located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rncbc.org/qpwgraph.conf`
(usually `~/.config/rncbc.org/qpwgraph.conf`). The configuration is saved when
the application closes.

## Patchbay

qpwgraph can remember the current connections and apply them again in a later
moment. This feature is called Patchbay, and it is further documented at [How
To Use The Patchbay](qpwgraph_patchbay-user_manual.md)
