# How To Use The Patchbay

Once a connection patchbay established, it is possible to store those connections in a patchbay configuration that can be then restored when loaded back.

## *Activated* button

The *Activated* button is simply to activate or not the loaded patchbay. The patchbay must be activated in order to access all the other functionalities.

If checked, connections stored in the loaded patchbay will be restored. All other connections will stay as they were before the load of the patchbay. If unchecked, no connection change at all.

## *Exclusive* button

The *Exclusive* button goal it to determine if the connections stored in the loaded and activated patchbay will be the only active connections or if previous connections are allowed.

If checked, connections not stored in the loaded and activated patchbay will be removed. If unchecked, the loaded and activated patchbay will only create the stored connections.

## *Edit* button

If checked, the buttons *Pin* and *Unpin* are available. Those functions are only for connections, so at least one connection (line between an input and an output) has to be selected.

### *Pin* button

Makes the connection persistant in the currently loaded and activated patchbay.

### *Unpin* button

Used to make the connection temporary. The unpinned connection will disappear forever if another patchbay is loaded.
